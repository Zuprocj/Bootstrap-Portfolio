# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Rebuilt the layout of the basic portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework.  Added the navbar to the top of the webpage that has a dropdown bar.  Added a responisive layout throughout the html files and responsive images for the portfolio.html.  Also created a sticky footer that works on the index and contact html files. However, I couldn't tell if the the portfolio sticky footer worked.
